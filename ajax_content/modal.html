								It is difficult to define Kathakali in a single word or single sentence. It is considered by rasikas all over the world as a highly stylized classical dance-drama. By mid seventeenth century, the King of Kottarakkara composed eight plays from the epic Ramayana and named them as RAMANAATTAM. Till today nothing is precisely known about the visual rendering of RAMANAATTAM. Probably the king had been inspired by the then indigenous art-forms of south Kerala and recreated their aesthetics and stage-craft in the visual-grammar and music of this new art form. Years later the King of Kottayam in North Kerala worked on RAMANAATTAM and evolved Kathakali with practical guidance of great gurus of NATYA and NRITTA. Several folk, ritual and classical arts have exerted a definite influence in the whole-sided development of Kathakali. It is the confluence of acting, dancing and music, vocal and instrumental. From the twenty-four basic hand-gestures the Kathakali actor has developed a language comprising of more than six hundred words. He enacts the many different characters in Kathakali using stylized hand-gestures, facial-expressions and body movements. In five different rhythms and four different tempos, the Kathakali characters unfold the text and the context of a play on stage.
