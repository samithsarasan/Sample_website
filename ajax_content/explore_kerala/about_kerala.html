							Kerala (38,863 km²; 1.18% of
							India’s landmass) is situated between the Arabian Sea to the west
							and the Western Ghats to the east. Kerala’s coast runs some 580 km
							in length, while the state itself varies between 35–120 km in
							width. Geographically, Kerala roughly divides into three climatically
							distinct regions. These include the eastern highlands (rugged and
							cool mountainous terrain), the central midlands (rolling hills), and
							the western lowlands (coastal plains). Located at the extreme
							southern tip of the Indian subcontinent, Kerala lies near the center
							of the Indian tectonic plate (the Indian Plate); as such most of the
							state (notwithstanding isolated regions) is subject to comparatively
							little seismic or volcanic activity. Geologically, pre-Cambrian and
							Pleistocene formations comprise the bulk of Kerala’s terrain. The
							topography consists of a hot and wet coastal plain gradually rising
							in elevation to the high hills and mountains of the Western Ghats.
							Kerala lies between north latitudes 8°.17'.30&quot; N and 12°.
							47'.40&quot; N and east longitudes 74°.27'47&quot; E and 77°.37'.12&quot;
							E.[2] Kerala’s climate is mainly wet and maritime tropical,[3]
							heavily influenced by the seasonal heavy rains brought by the
							monsoon.

							The history of Kerala, India, goes
							back more than several millennia. Stone age carving in Edakkal Caves
							had pictorial writings believed to be dating to at least 5000 BC,
							from the Neolithic man, indicating the presence of a prehistoric
							civilization or settlement in this region.[1] From as early as 3000
							BC, Kerala had established itself as a major spice trade centre.
							Kerala had direct contact across the Arabian Sea with all the major
							Red Sea ports and the Mediterranean ports as well as extending to
							ports in the Far East. The spice trade between Kerala and much of the
							world was one of the main drivers of the world economy. For much of
							history, ports in Kerala were the busiest (Muziris) among all trade
							and travel routes in the history of the world.

						<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
							The word Kerala is first recorded
							(as Keralaputra) in a 3rd-century BCE rock inscription (Rock Edict 2)
							left by the Maurya emperor Asoka (274–237 BCE).[2] The Land of
							Keralaputra was one of the four independent kingdoms in southern
							India during Asoka's time, the others being Chola, Pandya, and
							Satiyaputra.[3] These territories once shared a common language and
							culture, within an area known as Tamiḻakam.[4] The Cheras collapsed
							after repeated attacks from the neighboring Chola Empire and
							Rashtrakuta Empire. In the 8th century Adi Shankara was born in
							central Kerala, who travelled extensively across the Indian
							subcontinent, establishing institutions of Advaita Vedanta
							philosophy.

							One of India's most literate and
							socially advanced, the people of Kerala enjoy a unique cosmopolitan
							viewpoint, which is reflected in their spirit of tolerance and
							catholicity of outlook. This can be attributed to Kerala's composite
							culture to which several lands and races from across the world have
							contributed significantly.
						</P>
						
						<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
							Through the ages, Kerala has
							demonstrated a remarkable ability to adapt to new traditions and
							values in almost every sphere of human thought and endeavour. This
							positive response to changes and challenges is what sets the Keralan
							people as well as the society apart.
						</P>
						
						<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
							Keralites have a high degree of
							awareness and political consciousness. In the field of education too,
							Keralites hold a unique position. The literacy rate for women is one
							of the highest in all of Asia. Which is perhaps why the women in the
							State enjoy a privileged status both within the family and society.

							In Kerala, the three major seasons
							are summer (February-May), monsoons (June-August and
							October-November) and winter (December-January) with a pleasant
							interval of mild weather between August and October. There is no fall
							season, with any noticeable falling of leaves. Instead, towards the
							height of summer (March-April-May), there is a partial falling of
							leaves. It would still be hot summer, as your perspiring body would
							tell you.
						</P>
						
						<P STYLE="margin-bottom: 0.14in">
							<A NAME="_GoBack"></A>It gets
							increasingly hot during the summer season from February to May. A few
							showers in March or April might cool things a bit (not much).
							Temperatures typically reach 35 degrees centigrade and the blazing
							sun is no pleasant experience. Tree leaves become dry and begin to
							fall, though few trees become completely bare of leaves.
